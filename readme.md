CHALLENGE


:white_check_mark: - It is a popup that displays on a website once a visitor has been on a website for 3 seconds.

:white_check_mark: - Make the design into a responsive popover. Account for all breakpoints between desktop (1200px) and mobile (320px). The popover should look good on all breakpoints.

:white_check_mark: - Make the popover and form accessible (AODA/WCAG). Keypoints: I must be able to navigate the popover via keyboard and I must be able to close it via keyboard too. Ensure the form is accessible too.

:white_check_mark: - If the popover is closed, the popover should not deploy on any subsequent reloads/pageviews.
  -- using Local Storage in JS

:question: :question: - There are two visual elements on the page that need to animate when the popover is scrolled: The chisel on the left needs to animate up slowly when the popover is scrolled down and the shavings on the right need to animate downwards slowly. Kind of like a neat parallax effect.
  -- popup higher than viewport? In a real scenario, I would have asked for more details, and perhaps look at one example.
